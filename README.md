# PROJECT_4 - Demystifying Machine Learning 
# Global Data on Sustainable Energy (2000-2020)

## Project Requirements: 
Find a problem worth solving, analysing or visualising. Use machine learning with technologies that have been learnt over the course. You must use Scikit-learn and/or another machine learning library in addition to two or more other techniques. 

## Description
•	Uncover this comprehensive dataset showcasing sustainable energy indicators and other useful factors across all countries from 2000 to 2020. Dive into vital aspects such as electricity access, renewable energy, carbon emissions, energy intensity, financial flows, and economic growth. Compare nations, track progress towards Sustainable Development, and gain profound insights into global energy consumption patterns over time.

## Data sets
Kaggle-  Global Data on Sustainable Energy (2000-2020) | Kaggle
World Economic Forum – Energy Transition Index (ETI) benchmarks 115 countries on the performance of their energy systems.

## Data available: 
Some variables that we will look at are as follows:
* Entity: The name of the country or region for which the data is reported.
* Year: The year for which the data is reported, ranging from 2000 to 2020.
* Access to electricity (% of population): The percentage of population with access to electricity.
* Access to clean fuels for cooking (% of population): The percentage of the population with primary reliance on clean fuels.
* Renewable-electricity-generating-capacity-per-capita: Installed Renewable energy capacity per person 
* Financial flows to developing countries (US $): Aid and assistance from developed countries for clean energy projects.
* Renewable energy share in total final energy consumption (%): Percentage of renewable energy in final energy consumption.
* Electricity from fossil fuels (TWh): Electricity generated from fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas) in terawatt-hours.
* Electricity from nuclear (TWh): Electricity generated from nuclear power in terawatt-hours.
* Electricity from renewables (TWh): Electricity generated from renewable sources (hydro, solar, wind, etc.) in terawatt-hours.
* Low-carbon electricity (% electricity): Percentage of electricity from low-carbon sources (nuclear and renewables).
* Primary energy consumption per capita (kWh/person): Energy consumption per person in kilowatt-hours.
* Energy intensity level of primary energy (MJ/$2011 PPP GDP): Energy use per unit of GDP at purchasing power parity.
* Value_co2_emissions (metric tons per capita): Carbon dioxide emissions per person in metric tons.
* Renewables (% equivalent primary energy): Equivalent primary energy that is derived from renewable sources.
* GDP growth (annual %): Annual GDP growth rate based on constant local currency.
* GDP per capita: Gross domestic product per person.
* Density (P/Km2): Population density in persons per square kilometre.
* Land Area (Km2): Total land area in square kilometres. Latitude: Latitude of the country's centroid in decimal degrees.

## Machine Learning Application:
1: Predicting CO2 emissions using linear regression. 
2: Use variables listed above to determine the best model to predict the Energy Transition Index (ETI) score for each country in 2020.

First - pip install graphviz and pydotplus
